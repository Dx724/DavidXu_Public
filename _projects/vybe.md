Compatible with both iOS and Android, Vybe is a navigation wearable that aims to get you to your destination quickly and safetly -- with no sounds or visuals to distract. Never again will you have to risk a glance at your phone while approaching a busy intersection.

Utilizing Bluetooth Low Energy and a custom haptics stack, we aim to make navigation both safe and intuitive.

Our company began at a hackathon, where we developed the initial prototype of the Vybe. After a big win there, we went on to interview at Y-Combinator and have not stopped improving on it since.
