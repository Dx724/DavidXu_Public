oneline: An online game where players write algorithms to compete with each other.

Sporting an in-browser code editor, this game allows players to write their own algorithms to control agents which compete with one another in weekly challenges. Rather than competing for the highest score as with many algorithmic competitions, instead the agents are free to interact with, aid, and sabotage one another.
