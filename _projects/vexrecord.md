oneline: Carefully crafted autonomous routines for VEX robots take days to perfect. Yet sometimes, you need to generate one on the fly.

Traditionally, an autonomous routine for a VEX robot is carefully planned, implemented, and tuned over the course of several days. However, some teams may not have the programming skill or time to do so. More importantly, even the most skilled programmer can't develop a perfect routine without any testing in the midst of a competition.

This system allows a human driver to control the robot via a controller, recording the user's actions. Then, during competition, the routine can be played back, recreating the motions via precise control systems utilizing PID controllers, velocity measurements, voltage readings, and sensor values.

The system can been exceptionally useful for designing an autonomous routine to synergize with an alliance's strategy or to foil an opponent's plans.
