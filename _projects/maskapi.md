oneline: To use public services, wearing a mask is a must. Here's an easy way for anyone to integrate an automatic check.
---
- Wearing a mask has been shown to reduce the spreading of disease
- Yet, many refuse to do so, even in crowded public areas
- Many businesses currently refuse service without a mask, but it is up to employees to enforce this
    - This setup leads to conflict and exposes employees to risk
- This API provides a free online endpoint that any service can integrate, providing a fast and effective AI-powered mask check
- Sample applications include in-app verification for delivery drivers, entry checks in brick-and-mortar shops, or even customer verification when calling a taxi
