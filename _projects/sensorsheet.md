Applications:
- Rehabilitation (my friend recently tore his ACL, he hopes this will make physical therapy measurements less painful)
- Augmented reality control (the sensor sheet can be cut to a hand shape, sensing finger bending and contact)
- Sports monitoring (providing measurement of both posture and impacts)
