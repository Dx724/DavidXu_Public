Designed as a free alternative to expensive gaming consoles, users can use a computer as the display while controlling the games from phones or tablets.

Note: The hosted version is set to always run a snake game. Make sure you have at least one "display" and two "controllers" connected -- either on separate devices or separate tabs.
