- Modeled after string instruments such as the ukulele or the guitar
- On-the-fly configuration allows rapid changing of instrument or "capo position" (i.e., musical key)
- A joystick allows users to "pluck" digital strings
- Fret buttons encode information densely, allowing a larger range of musical expression in a smaller form factor
- Hardware interface is managed by an ESP32 which transmits user inputs to a Raspberry Pi for visual and auditory synthesis
