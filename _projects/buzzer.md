Created as a way to practice with my Quiz Bowl team, this website allows anyone to join a room with a computer or mobile device. Then, users can buzz-in at any time, with the earliest buzzes displayed to all.

Note: make sure you have at least one "display" and one "controller" connected -- either on separate devices or separate tabs. The initial load time may be slow, as the system is hosted on a free Heroku dyno.
