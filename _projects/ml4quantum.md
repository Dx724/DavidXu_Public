- Traditional methods of controlling quantum bits (qubits) rely on computationally-expensive optimization software
- Using machine learning, we can approximate such results with significantly fewer computational resources and at higher speed
- Designing a hardware accelerator would allow for such computation to occur directly within the low-temperature domains of a quantum computer, opening up new avenues for quantum computer design while decreasing costs and improving performance
