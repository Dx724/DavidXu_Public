oneline: A quick and simple way to enable yearbook signing online
---
- With the closing of schools around the world, many are missing out on yearbook signing -- a chance to share lasting messages with the people they've gone to school with for years.
- While some solutions exist, they rely on cumbersome login and account creation systems.
- YRBK.live is designed to be quick, secure, and registration-free. Via the usage of unique URLs, students can share their page so anyone can leave a message in an instant. Yet, only the owner can view these personal messages.
- (This website, frontend and backend, was made in a day. It's not the prettiest haha....)
