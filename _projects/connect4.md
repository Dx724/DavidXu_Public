![Initial Prototype](/res/connect4-prototype.jpg "Initial Prototype")
- Utilizes a custom 96-LED matrix arranged in an 8" tall cylinder
    - Prototype shown above, without wooden frame
- Drop a new piece... or flip a column or spin a ring
- Fast and fun, this project came complete with flowing animations
- Best of all, the matrix and controller were designed to enable full-board displays with only a few connections using persistence-of-vision tricks
    - You could make your own for a few dollars!

- Created with a team for the Columbia Art of Engineering Project Expo
