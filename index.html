            <div class="card-content"><p>Hospitals are currently exceeding capacity and strained for resources. Yet, in many cases, nurses and doctors must stay near patients to listen for alarms. Not only does this increase the exposure risk, it also further exacerbates the resource shortages.
<br />
<br />
While newer machines may support central telemetry, the majority of devices don‚Äôt. In addition, not only is it expensive to replace them, such a replacement results in substantial time costs from order processing, setup, and training.
<br />
<br />
Thus, this system was designed. It transmits audio signals from numerous rooms to doctors‚Äô computers, decreasing exposure and also increasing efficiency while improving patient care. Now, each doctor can monitor many patients via a powerful web or desktop interface. At the same time, each patient can now be monitored by numerous doctors.
<br />
<br />
In the end, this system aims to provide cheap, reliable, and secure patient monitoring for hospitals. The device is scheduled to be tested in hospitals soon.</p>

Utilizing Bluetooth Low Energy and a custom haptics stack, we aim to make navigation both safe and intuitive.
